Once upon a time, a group of people disconnected from each other struck a common awareness of making things better. They observed their software development processes carefully and found gaps.

They knew nothing of Jenkins, CircleCI, SonarCube etc, but in their endeavours of identifying the gaps and possible solutions they started optimizing the processes and ultimately started using some tools to automate executing those processes for them.

This article is an excercize to simulate that mindset. I would really like comments and notes on this, but even if you process it in your head and don’t want to leave a note/comment, that’s fine. Because as long as this article offers you a little switch in the cognition, it served it’s purpose.
